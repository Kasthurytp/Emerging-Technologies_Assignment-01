# Emerging-Technologies_Assignment-01

Final Assignment ( Cumulative)

This assignment covers following aspects
  - Build new test automation framework or extend existing framework for new set of test cases identified for given application
  - Develop Cucumber feature file for above nes test cases and extend the framework to cater a BDD scenario
  - Extend the solution with some AI concepts.
  
Application : https://demo.actitime.com/

Requirement : 
The HR Management application allows the HR to login with valid username and valid password. The HR once logged into the system successfully can
be able to look into Employee profiles and review leaves and attendance reports and Approval/rejection of the timesheets. Tech Coverage : Java, TestNG, 
Selenium,Maven,Excel/My SQL, Page Object Model Design , Extent Reports, log4j , GitHub

Section 1;
  1. Download below BDD code from GIThub location. Alternatively you may build your own framework as well.
          https://github.com/sarath-kadigamugedara/BDD_Demo
  2. Understand the framework based on below mentioned attributes and add new test case(s) for below scenario ( New user creation).
          a. Logging to the system as admin user
          b. Click on Users → New User
          c. Fill the mandatory fields and create a new user
          d. Validate that new user created successfully.
          
Framework Attributes:
        ● Build Hybrid Test Framework -- Page Object Model + Data Driven framework + TestNG & Maven Project Structure
        
        
Section 2:
        Write down a feature for the above scenario ( New user creation) and implement the required step definitions to automate it.
        
Section 3:
        In the given solution, there is page time out and wait time has been hardcorded in the TestUtil class. Please extend this with some AI concepts to build a solution to identify at
        least two different browsers and accommodate two different timeouts and wait time automatically.
